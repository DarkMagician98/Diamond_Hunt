# Diamond_Hunt

# Description
<p align = "left">The game will involve one main character the user is playing as.
The user must find a certain number of gems randomly spawned in the area.
The area will also have enemies randomly placed around the map.
The user must fend off these enemies while collecting the gems.
After a certain number of gems a win screen will be presented and the program will close out.
Note, the userâ€™s camera will only see a smaller portion of the map that will follow him around as he moves. 
If the user happens to run into an enemy the game will show a defeat screen and the game will close out.
The engine for this game was libgdx.</p>

# Technical Component
<p>The main technical component in our game will be procedural content generation.
Each level in this game is randomly produced using perlin noise.
Along with this, the gems and the enemy placement is also randomized. This means that each new
run of the level will be different than the pervious.</p>
